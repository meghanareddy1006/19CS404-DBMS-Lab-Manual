# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

### Entities and Attributes


| Entity | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
|MEMBER  |Member_ID (PK), Name, Membership_Type, Start_Date            |Tracks all gym members       |
|PROGRAM |Program_ID (PK), Program_Name, Type                          |Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training |
|TRAINER |Trainer_ID (PK), Name, Specialization                    |A trainer may take multiplE programs|
|SESSION |Session_ID (PK), Member_ID (FK), Trainer_ID (FK), Date, Time |For personal training sessions |
|ATTENDANCE|Attendance_ID (PK), Session_ID (FK), Status (Present/Absent)|Records session attendance   |


### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
|Member–Program (Joins)      |M:N |Partial|A member can join many programs       |
|Program–Trainer (Assigned)  |M:N |Total  |Programs can have multiple trainers       |
|Session–Attendance          |1:M |Partial|Each session must have attendance record       |

### Assumptions
Membership type determines allowed programs but not restricted in ER model. -Personal training sessions are optional. -Payments cover both membership fees and session fees.


# Scenario B: City Library Event & Book Lending System

**Business Context:**  
The Central Library wants to manage book lending and cultural events.

**Requirements:**  
- Members borrow books, with loan and return dates tracked.  
- Each book has title, author, and category.  
- Library organizes events; members can register.  
- Each event has one or more speakers/authors.  
- Rooms are booked for events and study.  
- Overdue fines apply for late returns.

|--------|--------------------|-------|
|    Member    |      MemberID (PK), Name, Address, Phone, Email              |   Library members    |
|      Book  |      BookID (PK), Title, Author, Category, ISBN, PubYear              |    Books in collection   |
|    Loan    |        LoanID (PK), LoanDate, DueDate, ReturnDate, FineAmount, MemberID (FK), BookID (FK)            |     Tracks book borrowing  |
|     Event   |         EventID (PK), Name, Description, EventDate, StartTime, EndTime, RoomID (FK)           |    Library cultural events   |

|      Booking  |             BookingID (PK), BookingDate, StartTime, EndTime, RoomID (FK), MemberID (FK)       |    Study room reservations   |

### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
|      Member–Book        |       M:N     |        Mandatory for Loan, Optional for Member/Book       |   Members borrow books    |
|    Member–Event          |      M:N      |     Mandatory for Registration, Optional for Member/Event          |   Members register for events    |
|   Event–Speaker  |      M:N      |    Mandatory for EventSpeaker, Optional for Event/Speaker |    Events may have multiple speakers   |

|  Room–Booking            |      1:N   |      Mandatory for Booking, Optional for Room         |   Rooms booked for study by members    |


### Assumptions
- Overdue fines are stored per Loan record.
- BookCopy not modeled
- Rooms serve both events and study bookings.

# Scenario C: Restaurant Table Reservation & Ordering

**Business Context:**  
A popular restaurant wants to manage reservations, orders, and billing.

**Requirements:**  
- Customers can reserve tables or walk in.
